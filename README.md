##Responsive Design Assignment #1

Step 1 - Smart phone - portrait mode - no CSS, no JavaScript

Step 2 - Use CSS and JavaScript to style the site using mobile user interface patterns

1. Non-scrolling title bar at top
2. Non-scrolling menu bar at bottom
3. Content should appear to scroll beneath the title and menu bars
4. Navigation menu that is revealed either by swipe or menu icon
5. Navigation menu should appear to be behind all other page elements

This should use fluid layout so that it works in either portrait or landscape mode on a "small" smartphone. Do not use media queries to handle orientation in this step.

Step 3 - Use media queries to adapt layout to a "medium" mobile device (tablet) in landscape orientation.

Use either fluid layout or media queries.

If it is going to be a substantially different layout than "medium" landscape, you must wireframe and get approval of the layout before proceeding.

##Other requirements

Single page site with at least 3 articles; must accommodate at least 20 or more articles. Articles are not limited in number of paragraphs.

No images.

Logo must be SVG format and 75x75px without styling. Version 2: 100x100px. Version 3: 200x200px.

The page title is used differently in all three layouts. See the wireframes for details.

The articles should scroll, but no scroll bar should appear. They are too small a target for mobile use. On a device, you should be able to flick them up and down easily and use the nav menu to jump to any article.

Test your work using Chrome Developer Tools in "device mode."

Feel free to use real devices to test your site when it is live on the web.
